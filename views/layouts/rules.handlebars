									<ul>
									<li>
										Battleship is an app based coding contest held by IECSE Manipal. The second round is based on the actual Battleship game.
									</li>
									<li>
										At the beginning of the game, you will have 0 points and 0 missiles. You will have 2 ships of sizes 2 and 3 in tetris format. The co-ordinates of these ships will be automatically generated and will be visible on the grid.				
									</li>
									<li>
										There are 20 questions in total - 15 easy, 8 medium and 1 hard. On solving an easy question you'll get <b>50</b> points and <b>1</b> missile.	On solving a medium question you'll get <b>100</b> points and <b>2</b> missiles. On solving a hard question you'll get <b>200</b> points and <b>4</b> missiles.			
									</li>
									<li>
										Once you get a missile, you can use it to make a hit on the grid. If it is a <b>HIT</b> (an enemy ship is present on that cell), then you'll get <b>75</b> points and you'll lose one missile. If it is a <b>MISS</b> (no enemy ship was present on the cell), you'll lose <b>1</b> missile and earn no points.				
									</li>
									<li>
										Note that if you make a hit and an enemy ship exists but some other team has already destroyed that cell, it will be considered as a <b>MISS</b>.
									</li>
									<li>
										You do not have to use your missiles immediately. You can choose to use them at any time during the competition.
									</li>
									<li>
										Other teams can hit your ships, and the corresponding cells will become inactive. If you want to be able to hit an enemy ship, at least one of your ship cells should be active.
									</li>
									<li>
										You also have the power to revive one of your cells at the cost of a missile.
									</li>
									<li>
										That's it now, start coding.
									</li>
